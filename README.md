Note: to activate an environment with conda, you need to already be in the conda base environment. This is usually done by default, but you may need to run the `conda init` or the `source activate base` commands before running the command below:

```bash
conda activate hunger-bunger
```

You should now be able to install all required libraries with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
